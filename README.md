# TELEHEALTH_PROJECT
Telehealth Project is a project to do health monitoring task. There are 4 parameters of health to be measured, those are heartrate, oxygen saturation, body temperature, and estimated blood pressure.
For Estimated Blood Pressure is not using general sensor, It's used PPG signal and Machine Learning approximation (Deep Neural Network) in order to obtain diastolic pressure and systolic pressure.
